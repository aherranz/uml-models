**Notes:**
  - <<repo>> stereotype represents repositories with information that is
    **preloaded**, extracted from **public databases**, information that
    use to be **immutable**
  - Temporal information will be important in particular if we capture
    intervention and counter-measures information (**difficult**)

**Doubts**

  - <<???>> stereotype represents doubts
  - What's Dimension?
  - What's Incident? is it a concrete attack?
  - How are **theats and exploits** related? are they the same thing?
  - Is the **counter-measures related to vulnerabilities or with
    threats**?
  - Penetration tests would relate to risks, counter-measures and
    interventions in order to assess the effectiveness of an intervention
